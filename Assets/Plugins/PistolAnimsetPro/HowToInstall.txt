INSTALLATION NOTES

If you are interested in just animations - delete everything except the folder "Animations".

--------------------------------------------

If you want the Playmaker controller:


1. Create a new Unity Project

2. Download and Import fresh version of Playmaker. Remember that PlayMaker has a 2-step installation - you have to install it after importing.

3. Import Pistol Animset Pro

4. Unzip and copy the contents of PistolAnimsetPro\UnzipAndCopyToProjectSettings-InputFile\InputManager.zip to ProjectSettings\ folder (do this outside Unity Editor).

5. Enjoy
